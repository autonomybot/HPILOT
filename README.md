# HPILOT (Hybrid PPO-LQR Isaac Leo Optimized Tracking)

GPU-accelerated Isaac Lab port of the Leo Rover RL stack. Sibling repo to
[leoroverpybullet_share](../leoroverpybullet_share). The PyBullet version
remains the production codebase for the URCA paper and any near-term work;
this repo is the long-horizon successor.

**Status:** core port implemented (Phases 1–4 + logging), pending on-GPU
validation. The previously-empty stubs are now filled with real, vectorized
implementations: the Mars terrain generator, the torch `VectorizedLQR`
controller, the `DirectRLEnv` base env + the flat/Mars/hybrid tasks, gym
registration, the rsl_rl PPO configs (v33.9 hyperparameters), the
PyBullet-schema CSV recorder, and train/play/compare scripts. The engine-agnostic
logic (paths, terrain stats, ADR curriculum, `config.py`, and the
`evaluate_training.py` analysis GUI) is carried over verbatim and shared with the
PyBullet repo. See **[MIGRATION_NOTES.md](MIGRATION_NOTES.md)** for the complete
file-by-file map, feature-parity checklist, known divergences, and the short
remaining-work list to first training run. Runtime has NOT been validated in this
environment (no local GPU); validate on your Isaac machine / RunPod GPU starting
with the Flat smoke test.

## Quick start

This repo is checked out as a sibling of leoroverpybullet_share, e.g.::

    Downloads/
        leoroverpybullet_share - Checkpoint Working (3) (1)/
        leorover_isaac/    ← you are here

If you haven't moved it yet:

1. Move this folder out of the PyBullet repo to be a sibling of it.
2. Run `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial scaffolding"` inside.
3. Push to a new GitHub repo (`gh repo create leorover_isaac --public ...`).

Then follow **[CLOUD_SETUP.md](CLOUD_SETUP.md)** to set up cloud GPU
access via RunPod. This is the recommended path — you keep Windows + your
games entirely untouched and rent a GPU on-demand (~$10–40/month for
part-time research). First training run in under an hour from signup.

If you'd rather have a fully local setup, [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) covers
the dual-boot Ubuntu 22.04 alternative. The original WSL2 plan turned out
to be unworkable on this Windows build — see [SETUP_HISTORY.md](SETUP_HISTORY.md)
for the debugging story.

After install (either path), follow [PORTING_ROADMAP.md](PORTING_ROADMAP.md)
for the phase-by-phase port plan.

Each subdirectory has its own README explaining what belongs there and

## Relationship to leoroverpybullet_share

This repo does NOT replace the PyBullet one. They will coexist indefinitely
for these reasons:

1. **Reverting is free.** If Isaac Lab turns out to have a fatal limitation
   for Mars terrain, the PyBullet code continues to work — there's no
   bridge or dependency between the two.
2. **PyBullet is the URCA paper's experimental platform.** All paper data,
   all checkpoints, all reproducible results live in that repo. Don't break
   that for anything.
3. **Validation requires comparison.** The port is considered "done" when
   the Isaac Lab version reproduces PyBullet success rates within 2 pp on
   identical terrain seeds. That comparison requires both codebases
   functioning.

Useful reference points in the PyBullet repo:

- `config.py` lines 1080–1135 — v33.9 reward weights
- `leoroverpybullet/envs/environment2.py` — the env logic to port
- `controller2.py` (in same folder) — LQR controller to vectorize
- `v33.9_changes.txt` — what each tuning decision was for

## Why Isaac Lab over PyBullet

Headline numbers from typical wheeled-robot RL benchmarks:

| metric | PyBullet (12 envs) | Isaac Lab (4096 envs) | speedup |
|--------|--------------------|------------------------|---------|
| sim steps / sec | ~5,000 | ~500,000 | 100x |
| wall-clock for 50M steps | ~5 days | ~1 day | 5x |
| time-to-first-success on a new reward | hours of debugging | minutes | qualitative |
| sim2real domain randomization throughput | bottlenecked | trivial | qualitative |

The 5x wall-clock speedup is less than the 100x sim speedup because PPO
overhead, env reset, and observation construction don't scale linearly
with parallelism. Still substantial.

## What is NOT in this port

Some PyBullet features intentionally don't migrate (see PORTING_ROADMAP.md
"What to NOT port" section for the full list). The big ones:

- The Tk-based `experiment_gui.py` — replaced by Isaac Lab's CLI + wandb
- `multiprocessing.Pool` parallelization in `comparison_workers.py` —
  Isaac Lab's native vectorization replaces it
- The `PerformanceRollbackCallback` — Isaac Lab's training is stable enough
  to not need it

## Reading order for a new contributor

2. [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) — get the dev env working
3. [PORTING_ROADMAP.md](PORTING_ROADMAP.md) — what to build and in what order
4. [leorover_isaac/envs/README.md](leorover_isaac/envs/README.md) — env API mapping
5. [leorover_isaac/controllers/README.md](leorover_isaac/controllers/README.md) — vectorized LQR notes
6. [leorover_isaac/terrain/README.md](leorover_isaac/terrain/README.md) — Mars terrain notes
7. [leorover_isaac/tasks/README.md](leorover_isaac/tasks/README.md) — task config pattern
8. [leorover_isaac/assets/leo_rover/README.md](leorover_isaac/assets/leo_rover/README.md) — asset conversion

That's enough background to start on Phase 1.
